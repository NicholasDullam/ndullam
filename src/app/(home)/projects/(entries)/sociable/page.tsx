          A platform for students to explore what's active on their campus.

        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p>
          College education can often be overwhelming and stressful with
          assignments and exams, amongst other tedious life situations. Social
          events allow for healthy releases of this stress and anxiety; however,
          it can be difficult to find these events since invitations are
          normally spread by word-of-mouth. sociable is designed to make taking
          a break from the stressful settings of college easier for Purdue
          students by being a unique central platform for popular social events
          taking place on and around Purdueâ€™s campus. By allowing students to
          create and join these events individually or on the behalf of their
          organizations, sociable brings to the market a new, easy way for
          students to stay involved and socialize. As a capstone project for CS
          407, we tasked ourselves to building sociable.

          Role |&nbsp;
          <span className="font-normal opacity-50">Scrum Master</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Working on sociable I served as the Scrum Master for the latter sprint
          of the project, working with a team of four other developers under
          SCRUM and Agile principles. We worked together to manage code reviews,
          pull requests, and hold our weekly standups for any notable changes
          made.
        </p>
        <h4>Creating a Social Network</h4>
        <p>
          When working on what would prove to hold the fundamentals of a social
          network, we focused on two main points -- ease of scalability, and
          ease of access. For all schema under the project, we would held the
          first question on what could be expected of the collection under
          scale, and took our initial iterations from there. It was important to
          ensure that the platform had minimal hiccups, and could push the
          growth of the content, connections, and the baseline userbase -- all
          things that can grow disproportionately. While schema were an
          important aspect of scaling, or next step was infrastructure. While we
          didn't aim to deploy in excess, we planned around the use of Redis,
          and a reverse proxy, allowing for independent scaling of compute for
          content distribution (given our live features of the platform).
        </p>
        <h4> Key Takeaways </h4>
        <p>
          Working on a native-first project was a new challenge for our group --
          but by falling into eachothers strength, whether it be frontend,
          backend, or fullstack, we met our "MVP" effectively.
