### What is this?
A personal portfolio site built atop the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Acts as an interpretive shell, being both personal programming sandbox for me to archive my works and a way to dive deeper into my past experiences.
### Getting Started
To prepare the production build and install relevant dependencies run...
```
npm install
```
To run the client run...
```
cd client
npm start
```
To run the server run...
